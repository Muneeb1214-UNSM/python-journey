#Operators in Python
#1 arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/,%)
a = 10
b = 20
print("the sum of a and b is :", a+b)
print("the difference of a and b is :", a-b)
print("the multiplication of a and b is :", a*b)
print("the division of a and b is:", a/b)
print("the modulus of a and b is:", a%b)

#2 Relational operators (<,>,<=,>=)
x = 5
y = 2
print(x<y)
print(x==y)
print(x<=y)
print(x>=y)

#3 Assignment operators (+=,-=,*=,/=)
j = 10
k = 5
print(j+=k)
print(j-=k)
print(j*=k)
